# Shari Kaplan Witaschek 
### Professional Copy Editor • Content Editor • Proofreader • Writer • AI Content Curator  
*(aka “Scary Shari” to friends — in the fun way!)*

I'm a detail-loving (a.k.a. nerdy) editorial expert and publishing operations specialist with
25+ years of experience across journalism, healthcare, newsletters, digital media, and content strategy.

I’m here on GitHub to explore open-source tools that support writing, editing, 
accessibility, and clear communication. I also use this space to share selected 
editorial samples and resources that align with my work.

## ✨ What I Do
- Copy editing, content editing, proofreading (AP style, AMA style, Chicago Manual of Style)
- Work with mobile apps, websites, digital newsletters, healthcare, magazines, social media campaigns
- Clarity-focused editing and plain-language communication
- Help writers express ideas with accuracy, warmth, and readability
- Maintain a personal “Fail File” of the typos I catch in the wild 😄

## 📁 Repositories Here
I use GitHub to share:
- Writing samples  
- Editorial portfolio materials  
- Before/after editing demonstrations  
- Useful writing and editing tools I've starred  

*(More coming soon.)*
